about: If you have found a dead domain listed in the hosts file
title: ''
labels: NSFW Adult Material, invalid
assignees: ''

I believe this specific domain(s) is to be moved from the hosts file as it no longer is active for Adult material

# Delete this
```
dead.example..com
```

# Keep this
```
example..com
alive.example..com
```
